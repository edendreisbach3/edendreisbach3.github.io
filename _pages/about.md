I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying physics at UCLA, with a research focus on plasma physics and magnetic confinement fusion devices. Since early 2024 I have worked in UCLA's Plasma Diagnostics Group under Dr. Neal Crocker and I spent Summer 2025 in the SULI Program, working under Dr. Robert Wilcox. I am also vice president of UCLA's chapter of Sigma Pi Sigma.

Research Interests:
- Magnetically confined fusion plasmas
- Computational modeling and numerical simulation
- Nonlinear dynamics, wave–plasma interactions, edge physics, pedestal structure
